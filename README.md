#Overview
NZWalks is a web-based platform designed to enhance the experience of exploring and discovering walking trails in New Zealand. The primary focus of this project is to develop a robust backend system that allows users to post and read detailed information about various walks across the country. A frontend interface is planned for the second phase of the project, which will offer a user-friendly way to interact with the backend functionalities.

#Objectives
Create a comprehensive database for walking trails in New Zealand.
Develop a backend system that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for walks.
Enable user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access and data integrity.
Implement API endpoints for posting, reading, updating, and deleting walk information.
Facilitate community interaction by allowing users to share reviews and ratings of walks.

#Key Features
User Registration and Authentication: Secure user sign-up, login, and profile management.
Walk Posting: Users can add new walks, including details such as location, difficulty, duration, and descriptions.
Walk Reading: Retrieve and display information about various walks, filtered by different criteria such as region, difficulty, and popularity.
Walk Updating: Users can edit the information of walks they have posted.
Walk Deletion: Users can remove walks they have posted if they are no longer relevant or accurate.
Community Interaction: Users can leave reviews and ratings for walks they have experienced, fostering a collaborative environment.
Search and Filter: Advanced search and filtering options to help users find walks that meet their preferences and needs.

#Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Asp.Net for handling server-side logic.
Database: SQLite for storing walk information and user data.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

#API Documentation: Swagger for documenting API endpoints and facilitating integration.
Hosting: Not yet implemented ;)

#Future Enhancements
Frontend Development: Build a responsive and interactive frontend using React or Angular, enabling users to easily navigate and interact with the platform.
Mobile Application: Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android to provide users with on-the-go access to NZWalks.
Advanced Features: Implement additional features such as GPS tracking for walks, social media sharing, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences and history.
Scalability: I intend to develop the app in such a way, that it is scalable and easy to pick-up by any other developer to build this in the future.
